# Add-button-to-ATG-CSC

This is a chrome extension to add a button to ATG's 9.4 CSC to fix an order search error we had and couldn't be fixed.  This will work with other ATG version,  you just need to adjust the button labels.  I tested on 9.2 and 9.4.

This just adds additional js code to the CSC page, which is very difficult to do, i am told using the native code. All the magic is done in the .js peice that is loaded externally, so you don't have to update the chrome extension every time you want to make a change.  

We are retiring our ATG on premise solution and moving to Oracle Cloud Commerce solution.  This will not be updated since we are retiring ATG CSC.
